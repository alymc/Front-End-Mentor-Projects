## Overview

The objective was to build a QR code component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that block elements need a specified height if content is not enough to cover the page. So my component would center horizontally but not vertcally. So
i added a height property to add vertical space that i could then use to center my component.
